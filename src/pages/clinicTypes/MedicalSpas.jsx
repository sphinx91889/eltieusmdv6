              <p className="text-gray-700">
                A medical director for a medspa fills a critical role for those looking to establish their aesthetics practice. Their primary responsibility is to ensure that your facility remains compliant with state regulations and healthcare laws. Most states will not allow a nurse to open a medspa without a medical director. For nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, this means it is necessary to have a seasoned professional who understands the complexities of medical oversight.
